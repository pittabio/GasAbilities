# Gas Abilities
An experimental project for exploring Unreal Engine's **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** and advanced code implementations.

**Project Status:** 🚧 In Active Development

## 📋 Description
GasAbilities is a learning and research project created to explore and master the Gameplay Ability System through practical examples. 
Built in Unreal Engine 5.6 using C++ and Blueprints, the project features a simple testing environment with basic enemies to experiment with various GAS implementations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Experiment with the Gameplay Ability System
- Test new implementations and code patterns
- Create a reference repository for future GAS implementations
- Build a collection of working examples for practical use

### 🎓 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning journey through GAS
- A reference for implementing GAS features
- A collection of working examples for future projects
- A resource for others learning GAS
